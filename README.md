* How does BCR work?
1. Take a photo or select a picture from the « Camera Roll ».
2. Scan the business card. BCR will automatically recognize the text and detect the fields.
3. Check the result. You may save to a new contact or merge with an existing contact.

* The Sugar connector for BCR
Ultimately, BCR may send data to an external system. The Sugar connector for BCR will create or update a contact in your Sugar instance.

* Installation
1. Sugar: install the BCR module using the module loader (Sugar 7 any edition).
The installation will create and populated a new field on the User module. This field will receive a token that will replace the password when talking to Sugar. This is a security requirement; otherwise your password will be recorded in your network equipments logs. 
The installation will create an email template that you might want to use in order to notify each Sugar user his new credentials when using BCR with Sugar.
2. BCR app: in the BCR export settings, go to the BCR API panel and set the following url:
Recommended:
https://<your domain>/index.php?entryPoint=BCR&u=<user name>&t=<token>
Not recommended:
https://<your domain>/index.php?entryPoint=BCR&u=<user name>&p=<password>
Go to the BCR export Menu, choose one or several business cards, select the last icon (BCR API). Click on “Export”.
Congratulation, the contacts had been created (or updated) in your Sugar instance!
